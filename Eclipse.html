					<p> A solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets between Earth and the sun, and the moon casts a shadow
						over Earth. A solar eclipse can only take place during the phase of the new moon, when the moon
						passes directly between the sun and Earth and its shadows fall upon Earth’s surface. But whether
						the alignment produces a total solar eclipse, a partial solar eclipse, or an annular solar
						eclipse depends on several factors, all explained below. The fact that an eclipse can occur at
						all is a fluke of celestial mechanics and time. Since the moon formed about 4.5 billion years
						ago, it has been gradually moving away from Earth (by about 1.6 inches, or 4 centimeters per
						year). Right now the moon is at the perfect distance to appear in our sky exactly the same size
						as the sun, and therefore block it out. But this is not always true. </p>

			</h1>
			<p> The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for
				all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many
				Sun-related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology. </p>

			<br>
			<p>Total solar eclipses are a happy accident of nature. The sun's 864,000-mile diameter is fully 400 times
				greater than that of our puny moon, which measures just about 2,160 miles. But the moon also happens to
				be about 400 times closer to Earth than the sun (the ratio varies as both orbits are elliptical), and as
				a result, when the orbital planes intersect and the distances align favorably, the new moon can appear
				to completely blot out the disk of the sun. On average, a total eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth about
				every 18 months. <br> There are actually two types of shadows: the umbra is that part of the shadow
				where all sunlight is blocked out. The umbra takes the shape of a dark, slender cone. It is surrounded
				by the penumbra, a lighter, funnel-shaped shadow from which sunlight is partially obscured. <br> During
				a total solar eclipse, the moon casts its umbra upon Earth's surface; that shadow can sweep a third of
				the way around the planet in just a few hours. Those who are fortunate enough to be positioned in the
				direct path of the umbra will see the sun's disk diminish into a crescent as the moon's dark shadow
				rushes toward them across the landscape. <br> During the brief period of totality, when the sun is
				completely covered, the beautiful corona — the tenuous outer atmosphere of the sun — is revealed.
				Totality may last as long as 7 minutes 31 seconds, though most total eclipses are usually much shorter.

					Eclipse</marquee>
			</h2>
			<p class="def"> A partial solar eclipse occurs when only the penumbra (the partial shadow) passes over you.
				In these cases, a part of the sun always remains in view during the eclipse. How much of the sun remains
				in view depends on the specific circumstances. <br> Usually, the penumbra gives just a glancing blow to
				our planet over the polar regions; in such cases, places far away from the poles but still within the
				zone of the penumbra might not see much more than a small scallop of the sun hidden by the moon. In a
				different scenario, those who are positioned within a couple of thousand miles of the path of a total
				eclipse will see a partial eclipse. <br> The closer you are to the path of totality, the greater the
				solar obscuration. If, for instance, you are positioned just outside of the path of the total eclipse,
				you will see the sun wane to a narrow crescent, then thicken up again as the shadow passes by. </p>

			<h2>
				<marquee direction="down" onmouseover="stop()" onmouseout="start()" scrollamount="3">Annual Solar
					Eclipse</marquee>
			</h2>
			<p> An annular eclipse, though a rare and amazing sight, is far different from a total one. The sky will
				darken ... somewhat; a sort of weird "counterfeit twilight" since so much of the sun still shows. The
				annular eclipse is a subspecies of a partial eclipse, not total. The maximum duration for an annular
				eclipse is 12 minutes 30 seconds. <br> However, an annular solar eclipse is similar to a total eclipse
				in that the moon appears to pass centrally across the sun. The difference is, the moon is too small to
				cover the disk of the sun completely. Because the moon circles Earth in an elliptical orbit, <b>its
					distance from Earth can vary from 221,457 miles to 252,712 miles. But the dark shadow cone of the
					moon's umbra can extend out for no longer than 235,700 miles; that's less than the moon's average
					distance from Earth.</b>
				<br> So if the moon is at some greater distance, the tip of the umbra does not reach Earth. During such
				an eclipse, the antumbra, a theoretical continuation of the umbra, reaches the ground, and anyone
				situated within it can look up past either side of the umbra and see an annulus, or "ring of fire"
				around the moon. A good analogy is putting a penny atop a nickel, the penny being the moon, the nickel
				being the sun. <br>

					Lunar Eclipse</marquee>
			</h2>
			<p> Lunar eclipses occur when Earth aligns between the sun and the moon and casts a shadow across the lunar
				surface. A lunar eclipse only happens during a full moon and can last as long as six hours, according to
				the European Space Agency (ESA). <br>
				<br> 2022 has seen and will see two total lunar eclipses that will be visible in many parts of the
				world. The first lunar eclipse occurred on May 15-16 and the second will occur on Nov. 8. To find out
				when, where and how to see this year's lunar eclipses, check out our lunar eclipse 2022 guide. <br>
				<br> A lunar eclipse is caused by Earth blocking sunlight from reaching the moon and causing a shadow
				across the lunar surface. The sun-blocking Earth casts two shadows that fall on the moon during a lunar
				eclipse: The umbra is a full, dark shadow, and the penumbra is a partial outer shadow.

				<p> According to TimeandDate.com(opens in new tab), a total lunar eclipse has seven stages:<br><br>
					<b> 1. Penumbral eclipse begins:</b> This first stage is not that noticeable to the naked eye and
					occurs when the penumbral shadow begins to move across the moon.<br>
					<b> 2. Partial eclipse begins:</b> The umbra begins to cover the moon. This is usually the first
					part of the eclipse visible to the naked eye.<br>
					<b> 3. Total eclipse begins:</b> As the umbra completely covers the lunar surface, the moon turns a
					blood-red color.<br>
					<b> 4. Maximum eclipse:</b> This is the stage of the eclipse with maximum coverage of the lunar
					surface by Earth's umbra.<br>
					<b> 5. Total eclipse ends:</b> Earth's umbra begins to move away from the lunar surface as the
					eclipse begins to wrap up.<br>
					<b> 6. Partial eclipse ends:</b> Earth's umbra leaves the lunar surface.<br>
					<b> 7. Penumbral eclipse ends:</b> Earth's shadow is no longer cast across the lunar surface.
					<br><br> During a partial lunar eclipse, only part of the moon enters Earth's shadow, which may look
					like it is taking a "bite" out of the lunar surface. Earth's shadow will appear dark on the side of
					the moon facing Earth. How much of a "bite" we see depends on how the sun, Earth and moon align,
					according to NASA(opens in new tab).

					<marquee direction="down" onmouseover="stop()" onmouseout="start()" scrollamount="5">Why is the moon
						Red During an Eclipse?</marquee>
				</h2>
				<p> During a total lunar eclipse, the lunar surface turns a rusty red color, earning the nickname "blood
					moon". <br> The eerie red appearance is caused by sunlight interacting with Earth's atmosphere.<br>
				</p>
				<div class="i4">
					<img src="images/Red Moon.jpg" height="400px" width="550px">
				</div>
				<p> sunlight reaches Earth, our atmosphere scatters and filters different wavelengths. Shorter
					wavelengths such as blue light are scattered outward, while longer wavelengths like red are bent —
					or refracted — into Earth's umbra, according to the Natural History Museum(opens in new tab). When
					the moon passes through Earth's umbra during a total lunar eclipse, the red light reflects off the
					lunar surface, giving the moon its blood-red appearance. <br>
					<br> "How gold, orange, or red the moon appears during a total lunar eclipse depends on how much
					dust, water, and other particles are in Earth's atmosphere" according to NASA scientists(opens in
					new tab). Other atmospheric factors such as temperature and humidity also affect the moon's
					appearance during a lunar eclipse.
