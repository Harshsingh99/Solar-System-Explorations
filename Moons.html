						Moons – also known as natural satellites – orbit planets and asteroids in our solar system.
						Earth has one moon, and there are <b> more than 200 moons</b> in our solar system. Most of the
						major planets – all except Mercury and Venus – have moons.<a href="Planets.html"> Pluto</a> and
						some other dwarf planets, as well as many asteroids, also have small moons. Saturn and Jupiter
						have the most moons, with dozens orbiting each of the two giant planets.

						Moons come in many shapes, sizes, and types. A few have atmospheres and even hidden oceans
						beneath their surfaces. Most planetary moons probably formed from the discs of gas and dust
						circulating around planets in the early solar system, though some are "captured" objects that
						formed elsewhere and fell into orbit around larger worlds

								<h3>Earth's Moon</h3>

								<p>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.

									The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more
									livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a
									relatively stable climate. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body
									collided with Earth.

									Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our solar
									system.

									Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't
									know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting
									Jupiter in 1610.

								<h3>Mars Moon</h3>

								<p><b>Mars' moons are among the smallest in the solar system. Phobos is a bit larger
										than Deimos, and orbits only 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) above the Martian
										surface. No known moon orbits closer to its planet. It whips around Mars three
										times a day, while the more distant Deimos takes 30 hours for each orbit.</b>
									Phobos is gradually spiraling inward, drawing about six feet (1.8 meters) closer to
									the planet each century. Within 50 million years, it will either crash into Mars or
									break up and form a ring around the planet.

									To someone standing on the Mars-facing side of Phobos, Mars would take up a large
									part of the sky. And people may one day do just that. Scientists have discussed the
									possibility of using one of the Martian moons as a base from which astronauts could
									observe the Red Planet and launch robots to its surface, while shielded by miles of
									rock from cosmic rays and solar radiation for nearly two-thirds of every orbit.

								<h3>Jupiter Moon</h3>

								<p><b>With a total of 79 known moons — including four large moons known as the Galilean
										satellites — Jupiter almost qualifies as a solar system unto itself.

										Most of the moons of Jupiter are small, with about 60 of the satellites being
										less than 6.2 miles in diameter.</b> The number of moons changes fairly
									frequently, with the 79th moon being reported in July 2018. Most of the moons were
									discovered in the late 1970s and later as a result of several explorations by
									automated spacecraft, including NASA’s Voyager in 1979 and Galileo in 1995.

									Not only is Jupiter <b>the largest planet in the solar system</b>, it is also the
									most massive at more than 300 times the mass of Earth. Its size plays a role in the
									number of moons orbiting Jupiter because there is a large area of gravitational
									stability around it to support many moons.

								<h3>Saturn Moon</h3>

								<p>At least 62 moons travel around Saturn. They come in a variety of sizes and
									compositions, from almost pure ice to rocky material, as well as a combination of
									both. Their journeys around the ringed planet range from half an Earth day to just
									over four Earth years.

									One of Saturn's moons, Titan, makes up 96 percent of the mass orbiting the planet.
									Scientists think that Saturn's system may have originally housed two such moons, but
									the second broke up, creating the debris that formed the rings and smaller, inner
									moons. Another theory suggests that the system originally housed several large
									moons, similar to Jupiter's Galilean moons, but two fused into Titan. The violent
									collision could have scattered the debris that would have later drawn together into
									the smaller moons.

								<h3>Uranus Moon</h3>

								<p><b>The planet Uranus has 27 known moons, most of which weren't discovered until the
										space age. They range from Titania, 981 miles (1,579 kilometers) in diameter, to
										tiny Cupid, only 11 miles (18 km) in diameter.</b> All satellites of Uranus are
									named for characters in William Shakespeare plays or characters from Alexander
									Pope's "Rape of the Lock," according to International Astronomical Union guidelines.

									Astronomers knew of five moons before the Voyager 2 spacecraft launched in 1977. The
									probe found an additional 10 when it swung by the system in 1986.

									"When [Voyager 2] flew past in 1986, it was winter and dark on the whole northern
									hemispheres of all the moons, so we could only see a portion of their southern
									hemispheres," Jeff Moore, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in
									California, told Space.com. "The encounter was also a bit like flying through a
									bull's-eye. Rather than one moon at a time, [Voyager 2] encountered the whole system
									at once."
