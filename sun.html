						The Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium
						– at the center of our solar system. It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from
						Earth and it’s our solar system’s only star. Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could
						not exist on our home planet.
						<br><br>
						From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat
						in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into
						space. The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called
						heliophysics.
						<br><br>
						The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles (1.4
						million kilometers). Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the
						biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it.
						<br><br>
						Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival, it’s only
						an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many
						solar systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the
						workings of distant stars.
						<br><br>
						The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million °F (15 million °C).
						The part of the Sun we call its surface – the photosphere – is a relatively cool 10,000 °F
						(5,500 °C). In one of the Sun’s biggest mysteries, the Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, gets
						hotter the farther it stretches from the surface. The corona reaches up to 3.5 million °F (2
						million °C) – much, much hotter than the photosphere.

			<h1>Namesake</h1>
			<p>
				The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for
				all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many
				Sun-related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology.
			</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>


		<div class="b2">
			<h1>Potential For Life</h1>
			<p>The Sun could not harbor life as we know it because of its extreme temperatures and radiation. Yet life
				on Earth is only possible because of the Sun’s light and energy.</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>


		<div class="b3">
			<h1>Size And Distance</h1>
			<p>
				Our Sun is a medium-sized star with a radius of about 435,000 miles (700,000 kilometers). Many stars are
				much larger – but the Sun is far more massive than our home planet: it would take more than 330,000
				Earths to match the mass of the Sun, and it would take 1.3 million Earths to fill the Sun's volume.
				<br>
				The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth. Its nearest stellar neighbor is
				the Alpha Centauri triple star system: red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light-years away, and
				Alpha Centauri A and B – two sunlike stars orbiting each other – are 4.37 light-years away. A light-year
				is the distance light travels in one year, which equals about 6 trillion miles (9.5 trillion
				kilometers).

			<h1>Orbit and Rotation</h1>
			<p>
				The Sun is located in the Milky Way galaxy in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward
				from the Sagittarius arm.
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="images/Orbit & Rot.jpeg" height="300px" width="350px">
				<br>
				<br>

				The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way, bringing with it the planets, asteroids, comets, and other
				objects in our solar system. Our solar system is moving with an average velocity of 450,000 miles per
				hour (720,000 kilometers per hour). But even at this speed, it takes about 230 million years for the Sun
				to make one complete trip around the Milky Way.

				The Sun rotates on its axis as it revolves around the galaxy. Its spin has a tilt of 7.25 degrees with
				respect to the plane of the planets’ orbits. Since the Sun is not solid, different parts rotate at
				different rates. At the equator, the Sun spins around once about every 25 Earth days, but at its poles,
				the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.
			</p>

		<div class="b5">
			<h1>Formation</h1>

			<p>
				The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago in a giant, spinning cloud of gas and dust called the solar
				nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of
				the nebula's material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of our
				solar system’s mass. Much of the remaining material formed the planets and other objects that now orbit
				the Sun. (The rest of the leftover gas and dust was blown away by the young Sun's early solar wind.)

				<br>
				<br>

				Like all stars, our Sun will eventually run out of energy. When it starts to die, the Sun will expand
				into a red giant star, becoming so large that it will engulf Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth as
				well. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last
				another 5 billion years or so before it becomes a white dwarf.
				<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				<br>
				Visible light from these top regions of the Sun is usually too weak to be seen against the brighter
				photosphere, but during total solar eclipses, when the Moon covers the photosphere, the chromosphere
				looks like a fine, red rim around the Sun, while the corona forms a beautiful white crown ("corona"
				means crown in Latin and Spanish) with plasma streamers narrowing outward, forming shapes that look like
				flower petals.
				<br>
				<br>
				<marquee width="100%" behavior="alternate" onmouseover="stop()" onmouseout="start()" scrollamount="3">
					<img src="images/s4.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></marquee>
				<br>
				<br>
				In one of the Sun’s biggest mysteries, the corona is much hotter than the layers immediately below it.
				(Imagine walking away from a bonfire only to get warmer.) The source of coronal heating is a major
				unsolved puzzle in the study of the Sun.
